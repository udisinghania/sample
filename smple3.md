## ‚≠ê Key Insight for Compliance Officers

**CART models have inherent regulatory advantages** due to their transparent structure. This roadmap leverages those advantages first (Weeks 1-7), then adds sophisticated analysis methods that enhance rather than replace the natural interpretability of trees.

The distinction between CART-specific and general methods helps you focus learning on techniques that maximize the natural advantages of tree-based models for regulatory compliance.
